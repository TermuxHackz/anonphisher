# Faqs
#### [1] What if i dont see the account info in termux? !
If you do not see the account info in the anonphisher terminal, simply go into the anonphisher logs directory and use the cat command to display the log.
#### [2] Link is not generating? !
Run the bash setup 
Turn on your device hotspot then select ngrok
Of link doesnt still generate, go to ngrok.com, download ngrok, set it up in termux, then copy your authtoken and paste it into your termuxhack home
Then turn on your device hotspot and run ./ngrok http 3333
After go back to the Anonphisher session and select ngrok
